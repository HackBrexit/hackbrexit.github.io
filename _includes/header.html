    <h2>Beyond Brexit: Creating dialogue and action for a country divided</h2>
    <p>Brexit is one of the most controversial and seismic political events in the UKâ€™s recent history. Yet throughout the pre-referendum campaigns and aftermath of Brexit many questions remain unanswered and the future unclear.</p>

    <p>Regardless of whether you voted in or out, this two day event is open to the tech and non-tech community to join forces to create dialogue and action beyond Brexit.</p>


    <p>We invite you to hack three key themes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Truth, fiction, & accountability</li>
      <li>Tolerance & prejudice</li>
      <li>Effective organising & campaigning</li>
    </ul>
