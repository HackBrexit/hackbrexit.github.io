<h1>Hack Brexit Open Source Accelerator</h1>

<h2>Introduction - Overview</h2>

<p>###  What is the accelerator all about?

* A three month programme that takes 2 of the 10 projects created during Hack Brexit weekend

* Run regular monthly meetings for the teams to present and discuss their projects progress, hosted by ThoughtWorks London.

* Help source additional volunteers to work with the teams on the projects

* The organising committee will be on hand to provide planning and process assistance over the whole 3 months, and tap into expertise from ThoughtWorks and Code First: Girls community

* The organising committee will manage external communications for the open source accelerator to help spread the word

* At the end of 3 months we will run a final external presentation event with external attendees, we will analyse the progress and development of the project along with its future potential for continuing to grow

* Connect the team members to the wider Hack Brexit meetup community


### Why are we doing this?

We want to continue from the success of the Hack Brexit hackathon on the 23-4 July to bring together technical and non-technical people to create tech solutions to drive dialog, unity and positive action beyond Brexit. We want to sustainably support and scale up projects that have a clear positive impact on society and respond to one of the three key themes we chose for the weekend: 1. Truth, fiction, & accountability; 2. Tolerance & prejudice; 3. Effective organising & campaigning.


### T&Cs for accelerator projects


* An open source project publicly available & accessible to all
* Projects are created in a repository under the Hack Brexit public repository with an MIT License
* Projects have an IP that is open to all & can be used by anyone
* Projects speak to one of the three key themes identified at the Hack (Truth, Fiction & Accountability; Tolerance & prejudice; Effective organising & campaigning) or a future theme as agreed by the community
* Commitment to work with a group of volunteers on the project for a duration of 3 months
* Work alongside your project team volunteers & the Hack Brexit organisers to plan the outcomes for at least 3 months
* Be a project that has scope to continue to be worked on by others in the future </p>
