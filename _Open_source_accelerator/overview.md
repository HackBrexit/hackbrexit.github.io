# Introduction - Overview

###  What will we learn

* How websites are made

* How to put up your own webpage

* Basic skills and tools that will be useful for any coding you do

We hope you will become curious about how the Internet works and will look at websites in a different way.

### How courses will be run

The hardest thing about learning to program is knowing **where** to start and **what** to learn.

The course **aims** to provide a basic overview of the technologies used, along with the tools and resources to discover more.

The **focus** of this course is learning the basics of how and why things work and to provide the basis to build upon in future courses. We will **not** be able to cover everything in great depth or comprehensive detail.

Sessions will be as **hands-on and practical** as possible. Each week there will be a number of tasks to do in between the sessions to reinforce what you have learnt.

It’s up to you whether you do the tasks or not, but the more you put in the more you will get out! If you’re ever in doubt, [Google it](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+do+i+use+google%3F), check [StackOverflow](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+do+i+use+stackoverflow), ask the person beside you, or ask one of us!

**Now, let’s check that you’ve installed all the right software and signed up for GitHub and the Student Developer Pack!**

**Note:**
