title: Hack Brexit open source accelerator overview

# Introduction - Overview

### Â What is the accelerator all about?

* A three month programme that takes 2 of the 10 projects created during Hack Brexit weekend

* Run monthly meetings for the teams to present and discuss their projects progress, hosted by ThoughtWorks London

* Help source additional volunteers to work with the teams on the projects

* The organising committee will be on hand to provide planning and process assistance over the whole 3 months, and tap into expertise from ThoughtWorks and Code First: Girls community

* The organising committee will manage external communications for the open source accelerator to help spread the word

* At the end of 3 months we will run a final external presentation event with external attendees, we will analyse the progress and development of the project along with its future potential for continuing to grow

* Connect the team members to the wider Hack Brexit meetup community

### Why are we doing this?

We want to continue from the success of the Hack Brexit hackathon on the 23-4 July to bring together technical and non-technical people to create tech solutions to drive dialog, unity and positive action beyond Brexit. We want to sustainably support and scale up projects that have a clear positive impact on society and respond to one of the three key themes we chose for the weekend: 1. Truth, fiction, & accountability; 2. Tolerance & prejudice; 3. Effective organising & campaigning.

### T&Cs for accelerator
